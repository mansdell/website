      <description>Hello again, world! We (the data group) have been slightly deliquent with this blog lately, but our collective New Year&amp;rsquo;s Resolution is to post more. (Not really, I just made that up. But here&amp;rsquo;s hoping!) This particular post is going to be fairly meta, because coming back to the blog after a break seems like a natural opportunity to reflect a bit.
In the last couple of months we made some changes to the format of our weekly group meetings.</description>
