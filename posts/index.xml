      <title>Occultations in reflected light</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on the problem of computing occultation light curves of planets and moons in reflected light. This is an extension of my starry code to the case where the specific intensity on the surface of the body is zero beyond the day/night terminator. To compute the light curve of an occultation event like that shown in the figure, we need to integrate the specific intensity of the body over the portion of the dayside hemisphere that is facing the observer and not obscured by the occultor.</description>

      <title>Turbulence Statistics</title>

      <description>The sites of star formation are self-gravitating, supersonic, magnetized turbulent clouds. These clouds are riddled with small-scale structure - clumps, filaments, and shocks - which undoubtedly play a role in how stars form. To understand these structures a bit better, my collaborator Nia Imara (Harvard) and I have been thinking about statistics we might use to characterize them!
Inspired by the Zel&amp;rsquo;dovich approximation, used to describe structure formation in cosmology as a succession of gravitational collapse into sheets, filaments, and halos or clusters, we&amp;rsquo;ve been exploring the following space.</description>

      <description>Hello again, world! We (the data group) have been slightly deliquent with this blog lately, but our collective New Year&amp;rsquo;s Resolution is to post more. (Not really, I just made that up. But here&amp;rsquo;s hoping!) This particular post is going to be fairly meta, because coming back to the blog after a break seems like a natural opportunity to reflect a bit.
In the last couple of months we made some changes to the format of our weekly group meetings.</description>

      <title>Stellar streams around the Milky Way in the Legacy Surveys imaging data</title>

      <description>The stellar halo of the Milky Way is full of debris streams — &amp;ldquo;stellar streams&amp;rdquo; — left over from dwarf galaxies and globular clusters that have been destroyed by our Galaxy&amp;rsquo;s gravitational field. These structures are diffuse, distant, and much lower density than foreground stars in, e.g., the Milky Way disk, which is why they don&amp;rsquo;t appear if you just plot the sky positions of all stars from a photometric survey like the SDSS or Pan-STARRS.</description>

      <description>As a new Flatiron Research Fellow who stared a few weeks ago, most of my time here so far has been taken up with getting myself set up in a new institute, and a new country. But, I’ve also had time to continue some of my thesis work from a few years ago now, which involves using the Made-to-Measure (M2M; Syer &amp;amp; Tremaine 1996) technique to tailor galaxy simulations to match data.</description>

      <title>Giant planets orbiting giant stars with TESS</title>

      <description>Along with starting at the Museum last month, I also kicked off a search for (large, so probably gaseous) planets orbiting low luminosity (3-10 Rsun) red giant branch stars with TESS. First, I used MAST to create a target catalog of stars using TICv8 stellar parameters, making cuts on stellar radius and temperature which left me with ~40,000 TESS targets. I then used the eleanor pipeline in order to download individual sectors of data of targets that were in TESS sectors 1 and 2.</description>

      <title>Removing HST Systematics based on Our Knowledge of K2 Systematics</title>

      <description>This week, Rodrigo and I have been working on using our knowledge on removing instrument systematics from Kepler to better understand how to remove instrument systematics from HST. In my research I use HST’s Wide Field Camera 3 to observe transiting exoplanets in the infrared, and use the spectrum to try to identify water in the upper atmospheres of planets. This is a tall order, seeing as the signals we are looking for are &amp;lt;200ppm, and the instrument systematics can easily introduce correlated noise at the 0.</description>

      <title>Fitting single transits</title>

      <description>Shortly before group meeting, I asked Twitter what I should work on today (see above). But, working on writing the paper is much less fun than thinking about new features so I went through a derivation of the right &amp;ldquo;priors&amp;rdquo; to use when characterizing a single transit. I have previously published on this topic (as have many others!) and the basic idea is that even if you only detect a single transit you can place some constraint on the orbital period because the duration of the transit is informative.</description>

      <title>Finding Anomalies in Galaxy Surveys</title>
      <link>https://astrodata.nyc/posts/2019-08-23-anomalies/</link>

      <guid>https://astrodata.nyc/posts/2019-08-23-anomalies/</guid>
      <description>I have been working on a new method for detecting anomalies in astronomical images with deep learning, with Marc Huertas-Company (Observatoire de Paris) and Alexie Leauthaud (UCSC). The idea is to use unsupervised learning to pick out potentially interesting (or &amp;ldquo;anomalous&amp;rdquo;) objects in galaxy surveys, as there is way too much data to look through by hand; the lack of supervision also means we can find interesting things we may not know to look for.</description>

      <title>The Transition Redshift</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m working on a short reionization project where we want to figure out where a function crosses zero. I&amp;rsquo;ll spare the details of what this function (P21,g) is for the bottom of this post. But suffice it to say that the redshift where it transitions from being positive to negative (the &amp;ldquo;transition redshift&amp;rdquo;) is an interesting quantity. The plot shows a sketch of what the data might look like - where the function itself is not measured but the data still constrai</description>

      <title>Doppler Imaging</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m generally interested in the problem of mapping the surfaces of stars and exoplanets, and while I&amp;rsquo;ve focused so far on doing this using photometric timeseries, for the past couple months I&amp;rsquo;ve been tinkering with spectroscopic data and the idea of Doppler imaging. The basic idea here is to take high resolution spectra of a rapidly rotating star at different rotational phases and look at the distortion of its spectral lines as starspots rotate from the blueshifted hemisphere to the redshifted hemisphere.</description>

      <title>Python Toolkit for Background-Subtracted TESS Lightcurves</title>

      <description>Over the summer I&amp;rsquo;ve been working with Dan Foreman-Mackey and David Hogg on developing a Python toolkit to obtain background-subtracted TESS lightcurves from the Full-Frame Images (FFI). One of the goals of this project is to detect transient events in the TESS data by doing difference imaging without constructing a reference image. We do that by implementing a method called Causal Pixel Model (CPM) Difference Imaging explained in detail here and here.</description>

      <title>The straight stellar stream in Cen A</title>

      <description>I recently attended the IAU Symposium 355 “The Realm of the Low Surface Brightness Universe”, where I had the chance to get an update on the current observational status of, among other things, detecting streams in external galaxies. Denija Crnojevic showed her map (Crnojevic et al. 2016) of the nearby galaxy, Centaurus A (see left panel of the Figure above). This lead to some discussion on the “straightness” of the stellar stream emerging from the dwarf galaxy referred to as Dw3 in the figure.</description>

      <title>Dust Inference</title>

      <description>I have been working with Andy Miller (Columbia) on building a 3D dust map of the Milky Way galaxy using a Gaussian process prior on 1e9 stars from Gaia. Of course we always want to solve all of astronomy, and infer the dust map and the color magnitude diagram simultaneously. But for a first step we want to model a dust-free CMD, infer individual dust estimates for stars, and then build the GP model on these individual estimates.</description>

      <description>This is the first post for our site and it&amp;rsquo;s pretty meta. This week at group meeting, I presented this blog to the group (pictured above). Our goal is to use this as a way to highlight some of the things that we work on in our group, to give ourselves some amount of accountability, and to practice open and transparent science. After this post, the plan is that each week one group member will post the figure that they presented in group meeting with a short description of what they&amp;rsquo;re working on, what they&amp;rsquo;ve recently learned, and (perhaps) where they&amp;rsquo;re stuck.</description>
